karate Framework :
------------------------
	Karate is a BDD automation framework. It consists of the feature file with .feature extension and the test runner file.
In order to use the Karate framework, we need to add couple of dependencies like junit and karate-junit
In the feature file, we write the tests using the Gherkin keywords, 'GIVEN', 'WHEN', 'THEN', 'AND', 'BUT'.
The Test Runner file is used to execute the tests in the feature file. We need to use @RunWith(Karate.class)
and use the @KarateOptions to specify the tags for execution.
